    <h1>Easy Apple Cider</h1>
    <div class = "description">
      <p>This apple cider recipe is super easy to make. 
        I used to buy the spices already mixed at the grocery store, 
        and they stopped carrying them, so I just made my own. 
        Great for a shower or get-together, and the slow cooker 
        keeps it warm so guests can enjoy it through the night! 
        Serve with a slice of orange, and add spiced rum, if desired.
