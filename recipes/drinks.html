    <h1>Pumpkin Latte Spice Bombs</h1>
    <div class = "description">
      <p>Inspired by cocoa bombs, these latte bombs are loaded with instant coffee 
        and pumpkin pie spice on the inside for a fun DIY latte. The white chocolate 
        sweetens the coffee perfectly â€” just add a dollop of whipped cream and sprinkle 
        with pumpkin pie spice (or a drizzle of caramel) for the ideal latte consistency.
